            this webpage just shows the features that I wanted to put
        </h1>
        <p>
            1. I wanted a maps something(delivered)<br>
            2. I wanted an error glitch page<br>
            3. I wanted a falling glitch box(delivered but not really how I imagined it to be)<br>
            4. I wanted a pixel mayhem that slowly creeps into the center of the page when hovering over a glitch.<br>
            5. I wanted a music API<br>
            6. I wanted to make use of a distortion API so that the music will become uncanny when hovering over the class glitch<br>
